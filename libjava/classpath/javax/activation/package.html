<p>
The GNU JavaBeans&trade; Activation Framework (JAF) provides a 
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">Free</a> implementation of the 
JavaBeans&trade; Activation Framework, version 1.1.
</p>

<p>
JAF links together beans and internet standards for specifying MIME
types and how MIME types are processed. It provides a means to associate
data of a given MIME type with bean actions operating on that data.
</p>


<h4>Important files</h4>

<p>
Standard <code>mime.types</code> files are parsed by the JAF MIME
handling classes to work out the MIME types available on the local
system.
</p>

<p>
Standard <code>mailcap</code> files (defined in RFC1524) are parsed by
mail capability handling classes to work out what beans should be linked
to what MIME types.
