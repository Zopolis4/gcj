    FIXME: we don't use %|, even though we could, because we need the
    dependency zip to be ready early enough.  We could work around
    this by not having a dependency zip and instead teaching jc1 to
    read a special manifest file included in the sole zip, this
    manifest would say which files are to be compiled and which are
    not.
